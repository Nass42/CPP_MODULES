In C++, static_cast is a type conversion operator that allows you to convert a 
value from one type to another, provided that the two types are compatible.
It is used to explicitly convert one type to another and is typically used 
when you want to convert a value to a related type, such as when you want to 
convert a base class to a derived class or when you want to convert a float to 
an int.


const_cast is a C++ operator that allows you to change the const or volatile 
qualification of a variable. This means you can remove the const or volatile 
qualifier from a variable, or add it back if it has been removed.


For example, you might use reinterpret_cast to treat a pointer to an integer 
as a pointer to a float, or to treat an integer as a pointer to a structure. 
This can be useful when working with low-level data structures or when trying 
to perform bitwise operations on values that are not naturally compatible.
